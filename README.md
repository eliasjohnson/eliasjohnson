## About Me

Software Developer passionate about building cool software, cloud-based solutions, and AI-powered applications. Currently working on game analytics and data visualization projects while exploring opportunities in support engineering, software engineering, and solutions architecting. Based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Recently graduated from Utah Valley University with a degree in Information Systems and with a Computer Science minor. I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions and bridging the gap between technical implementation and business value.
